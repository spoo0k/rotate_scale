## ðŸ”§ QML Multi-Directional Scaling and Rotation Tool

This project demonstrates how to implement a resizable and rotatable rectangle \
using QML with Matrix4x4 transformations for full control over scale and rotation.

âœ¨ Features\
âœ… Drag handles to scale in all four directions (corners)\
âœ… Click to rotate the rectangle by 10Â° increments\
âœ… Uses Matrix4x4 for advanced transformation control\
âœ… Works independently of Scale or Rotation QML types\
âœ… Custom draggable handles\
